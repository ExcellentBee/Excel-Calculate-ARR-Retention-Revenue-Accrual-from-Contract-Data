Purpose: Welcome to my step-by-step guide on mastering key SaaS revenue metrics: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Retention Rate (and Churn Rate), and Revenue Accrual! 

The main focus of this blog post is to illustrate all the data processing and calculation steps needed to arrive at these critical top-line metrics for a subscription-based business using contract data. By looking at specific examples, we will differentiate between ARR and Revenue Accrual, shedding light on how the 2 concepts, while related, are not the same. Depending on specific ASC 606 rules being applied, they donâ€™t even necessarily converge or grow at the same rate YoY. For ease of understanding, we assume revenue for all contracts in this dataset can be prorated from Start to End dates (equal daily dollars).

When we need to evaluate a SaaS start-up for acquisition, these steps are essentially the Due Diligence tasks to access the trend, strength, and run-rate potentials of the firm.
